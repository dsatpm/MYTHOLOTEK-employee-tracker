# Employee Tracker

mySQL database that allows the user to add a department, a role within the company, a new employee, or update a current employees information which is stored in a mySQL database. This project was very challenging to complete. I did use ChatGPT to come up with mythical job titles, departments, and a short list of made-up employees. Otherwise, this project is a demonstration of how to use mySQL to organize and edit data.


## Installation

This application requires the use of Node.js. To install Node.js, refer to [this](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/) documentation. All of the functionality of the program is within the console or terminal of your machine. 


## Usage

The application is an example of how to use and manage a database of information. It is an incredibly powerful tool when dealing with a lot of data. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16OA3Wm7n1TzKn5nqhqbO2Ti_JunAb91O/view) is a video demonstration of the project in action.


## Credits

This program was created by [me](https://github.com/dsatpm), but I did use a few outside sources for some of the data within the database
  - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) provided the generated names of jobs, departments, and some of the names in the employee database.

### Additional Sources
  - [mySQL](https://npmjs.com/package/mysql2) documentation to learn proper syntax, as well as references and pulling information from one table to another. It was also very helpful to understand 'promises' and 'executing'
  - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) for parsing through syntax errors and some bugs
